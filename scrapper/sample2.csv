This seasonal coffee, sourced from Brazil with our friends at Falcon Coffees, selected and expertly roasted by our team to highlight the very best that Brazil has to offer. And trust us, we mean the absolute best!<br data-mce-fragment=""1""/><br data-mce-fragment=""1""/>Allow us to introduce Fazenda Rancho Grande, a farm driven by a steadfast mission to responsibly cultivate coffee of unparalleled quality while diligently upholding environmental stewardship and employee welfare. Embracing innovation, Fazenda Rancho Grande has made substantial investments in multiple static drying boxes, elevating the caliber and flavour profile of their coffee offerings. This marks our third year of partnership with Jose and Flavio from Rancho Grande, as we continue to work together in 2023.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""/><br data-mce-fragment=""1""/>Their unwavering commitment to perfection extends throughout every step of the coffee production process, from cultivation and careful picking to the post-harvest treatment. Once the beans are plucked at the peak of ripeness, they undergo a process of separation based on density, ensuring only the finest specimens make the cut. These chosen beans are then pulped, expertly removing almost all the mucilage, and carefully transported to the patios where they bask in the sun for a period of 7 to 10 days.<br/></p>",https://fivewayscoffee.com/cdn/shop/products/MOVES-LIKE-JAGGER.jpg?v=1680082243,Brazil - Moves Like Jagger - Natural,"€6,00"

This area is home to two primary communities, Shantawene and Keramo. The lots produced here are traceable micro-lots, thanks to the community-based exporter, Daye Bensa.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""/><br data-mce-fragment=""1""/>The wet mill operations are skilfully managed by a team that includes Atkilt Dejene, a female agronomist who has also contributed her expertise to the esteemed Gesha Village project, among others. Additionally, Eyasu Bekele, a processing specialist with whom we have collaborated on the successful Reko Koba project for several years, is part of the team. While the Bombe washing station has a maximum capacity of 2.5 million kilograms of cherries, it has maintained a steadfast commitment to prioritising exceptional quality over quantity.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""/><br data-mce-fragment=""1""/>This specific lot has undergone a shade drying process as a natural coffee, sheltered under a mesh canopy to create a slower and gentler drying period. This approach has extended the drying time to 25 days, with the same group of individuals diligently turning the tables every 15 minutes to ensure even drying and consistent quality.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""/><br data-mce-fragment=""1""/>The resulting profile is characterised by sweetness akin to passionfruit (pornstar martini), accompanied by a creamy texture reminiscent of whipped cream.</p>",https://fivewayscoffee.com/cdn/shop/products/250_2BDa_2Bbomb_2Besp_2Bstraight.jpg?v=1680082194,Ethiopia - Bombe - Natural,"€12,00"
